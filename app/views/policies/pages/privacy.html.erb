Providers in order to provide and support the features of our
Services. For example, if it is necessary to provide you something
you have requested (like send you a T-shirt or enable a feature such
as Social Profiles), then we may share your Personal Information with
a Service Provider for that purpose. We will tell you we are working
with a Service Provider whenever reasonably possible, and you may
request at any time the names of our Service Providers. Just like
with the other third parties we work with, these third party Service
Providers enter into a contract that requires them to use your
Personal Information in a manner that is consistent with this policy.</font></font></font></p>
